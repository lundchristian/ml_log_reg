# Machine Learning - Logistic Regression

This repo contains a simple supervised machine learning model applying logistic regression to predict a music sample as belonging to either the pop or classical genre. It is trained based on features concerning loudness and liveness.

Follow the notebook named `main.ipynb`, the only requirements is hopefully python (version >= 3.10), a kernel for the jupyter notebook, as well as the third-party libraries `numpy`, `pandas` and `matplotlib.pyplot`.
